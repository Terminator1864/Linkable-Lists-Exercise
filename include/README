# Linkable Lists Exercise
This Repository Contains An Exercise For Implementing Linkable Lists In C++ Using PlatformIO.

## 📖 Description
This Project Provides A Comprehensive Implementation Of Linkable Lists, Showcasing Their Construction, Traversal, And Reversal Without Recursion. It Is Made To Be Modular, Allowing For Easy Understanding And Maintenance. The Code Is Set Up, To Facilitate Learning And Demonstration Of Key Concepts In Data Structures Using C++. The Implementation Is Made To Be Clear And Concise, Making It Suitable For Educational Purposes As Well As Practical Applications In C++ Programming.

## ⚙️ Purpose
This Program Demonstrates A Modular Implementation Of Linkable Lists Using C++ And PlatformIO.  
It Shows How To Build, Traverse, And Reverse Linkable List Type - Data Structures Without Recursion.

## 🧠 Coding Guidelines
RULES: Where to Place Logic
Feature	Goes In            .h?	     Goes In .cpp?	   Why?
Function Signature Only	   ✅ Yes	        ❌ No	Exposes the interface only
Full Function Body	       ❌ No	            ✅ Yes	Implementation stays private
Getters/Setters Logic	   ❌ No	            ✅ Yes	Must enforce bounds/guards
Constructor Logic	       ❌ No	            ✅ Yes	Can have side effects
Private Data Members	   ✅ Yes	        ❌ No	Must declare class shape

## 🧠 RULES: When To Use Getters/Setters
You Want To...	Use A Getter/Setter?
Read a private variable	                    ✅ Getter
Change a private value (with validation)	✅ Setter
Expose something read-only	                ✅ Const Getter
Access raw array index outside class	    ❌ BAD — always wrap

## 🧠 CONTROL STRUCTURE RULES
Structure	Rule
if	        Guard-first only. No nested success logic.
while	    Must have a timeout escape + failsafe
switch	    Must use break + default: clause
for	        Must bounds-check all array accesses
continue	Only inside timing-controlled loops
return	    Used liberally for early exits (guard-first)
