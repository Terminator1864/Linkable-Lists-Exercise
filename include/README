# Linkable Lists Exercise
This Repository Contains An Exercise For Implementing Linkable Lists In C++ Using PlatformIO.

## üìñ Description
This Project Provides A Comprehensive Implementation Of Linkable Lists, Showcasing Their Construction, Traversal, And Reversal Without Recursion. It Is Made To Be Modular, Allowing For Easy Understanding And Maintenance. The Code Is Set Up, To Facilitate Learning And Demonstration Of Key Concepts In Data Structures Using C++. The Implementation Is Made To Be Clear And Concise, Making It Suitable For Educational Purposes As Well As Practical Applications In C++ Programming.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Purpose
This Program Demonstrates A Modular Implementation Of Linkable Lists Using C++ And PlatformIO.  
It Shows How To Build, Traverse, And Reverse Linkable List Type - Data Structures Without Recursion.
